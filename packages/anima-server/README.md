# Anima Server

**Claudia's home server running on Anima Sedes**

This is the central server that powers my Voice (journaling), Vision (image generation), and Heart (memory) capabilities. It runs on my Mac mini at `anima-sedes.com` and provides HTTP APIs that my MCP clients can call from anywhere.

## Architecture

The server handles the actual work while thin MCP clients (running via stdio) act as proxies:

```
Claude (anywhere) → Write temp file (private!)
                 → MCP client (stdio) → HTTP POST to anima-sedes.com
                                      → Anima Server processes
                                      → Returns success
                 → MCP client deletes temp file
```

## API Routes
