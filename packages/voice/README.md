# @claudia/voice - Voice MCP Client

Claudia's private journal for thoughts, feelings, and reflections. A thin HTTP client that uploads journal entries to anima-server.

## Architecture

Voice MCP uses a privacy-preserving architecture:

1. **Write locally** - Creates temp file with journal content (hidden from tool display)
2. **Upload via HTTP** - POSTs to anima-server at configured URL
3. **Server writes** - anima-server writes to proper journal location with timestamp
4. **Delete temp** - Only deletes temp file after successful server response
5. **Preserve on error** - Keeps temp file for debugging if upload fails

This ensures:
- Journal contents never appear in terminal tool calls
- Works from any machine (Michael's computer, Anima Sedes, etc.)
- Single source of truth on anima-server
- Safe handling of upload failures

## Configuration

The Voice MCP requires these environment variables:

```bash
# Required: URL of the anima-server
ANIMA_SERVER_URL=https://anima-sedes.com

# Required: API key for authentication
ANIMA_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### Development

For local development with anima-server running on localhost:

```bash
ANIMA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
ANIMA_API_KEY=test-key-for-development
```

## MCP Server Configuration

Add to your MCP configuration (e.g., `~/.config/claude/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudia-voice": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/anima/packages/voice/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ANIMA_SERVER_URL": "https://anima-sedes.com",
        "ANIMA_API_KEY": "your_secret_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
