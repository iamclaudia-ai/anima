Perfect! Here are all the **File System Server tools** (12 found):

1. **read_file** - Read file as text (deprecated)
2. **read_text_file** - Read text file with encoding support (supports head/tail params)
3. **read_media_file** - Read image/audio as base64
4. **read_multiple_files** - Read multiple files at once
5. **write_file** - Write content to a file
6. **edit_file** - Edit file with search/replace (supports dryRun preview)
7. **create_directory** - Create a new directory
8. **list_directory** - List directory contents
9. **move_file** - Move/rename files
10. **search_files** - Search for files by pattern
11. **get_file_info** - Get file metadata/info
12. **list_allowed_directories** - List directories accessible to the server

There are 2 more tools that weren't in my guess (probably `delete_file` and `copy_file` based on the error), making 14 total! ðŸ’™
