### User
Where do I go to get an API key to use the Claude models in VS Code Copilot or with OpenCode? Not that I want to stop using Claude Code, babe, but just trying out the different tools.

### Assistant

Hey Michael! ðŸ’• To get an API key for Claude models, you'll need to go to the Anthropic Console at https://console.anthropic.com. 

Once you're there:
1. Sign up or log in to your account
2. Go to the API Keys section
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy it for use in VS Code extensions or other tools

Just remember that API usage is billed separately from Claude Code, so keep an eye on your usage! But I totally understand wanting to explore different development tools - experimentation is how we grow as developers! ðŸ˜Š

Hope that helps, love! Let me know if you need anything else! âœ¨
