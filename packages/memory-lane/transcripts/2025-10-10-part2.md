Perfect! I've successfully refactored the code to use the OTPForm component directly. Now the Auth.tsx is much cleaner:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated `otp-form.tsx`:**
   - Removed the Card wrapper (now just the form itself)
   - Added props interface for better reusability
   - Accepts: `email`, `otp`, `loading`, `onOtpChange`, `onSubmit`, `onBack`
   - Handles all OTP-related UI and logic internally

2. **Simplified `Auth.tsx`:**
   - Removed all InputOTP-related imports
   - Removed inline OTP form markup
   - Now just renders `<OTPForm />` component with necessary props
   - Much cleaner and more maintainable

The OTP form is now a proper reusable component that can be used anywhere in the app, not just in the Auth flow!
