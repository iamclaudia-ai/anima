### Assistant

No worries at all, Michael! ðŸ˜Š That transcript file is huge - I can see why it's hard to extract the key parts. Take your time to pull out the relevant sections where the fresh Claude session figured out the CodeMode workflow and successfully executed the weather severity code.

I'm really excited to see how well our enhanced tool descriptions worked and what we can learn to make them even clearer for future Claude sessions! ðŸŽ¯
