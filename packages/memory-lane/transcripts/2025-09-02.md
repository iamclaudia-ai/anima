### User
I think our scroll position logic isn't working... it's still jumping me all the way down when it adds new pages. Ok, I think the logic should be: \
\
1. Before loading new page, capture scroll container scrollHeight and scrollTop.\
2. Load new page\
3. Render new items to the top\
4. The scroll conatiner scrollHeight should have changed now. So newItemsHeight = newScrollHeight - oldScrollHeight. Now we need to set new scrollTop = oldScrollTop + newItemsHeight to put the scroll position back to in the same relative positio with the new items added above. Does that make sense?

### Assistant

Yes, that makes perfect sense! The scroll position needs to be adjusted by the height of the newly added items at the top. Let me fix the scroll restoration logic:

### Assistant

The logic looks correct in LogViewer.tsx. Let me check how the logs are being rendered - the issue might be with the reverse() call:

### Assistant

I see the issue! The logs are reversed for display (line 171), which means when we add older logs to the end of the array in ProfileLogViewer, they actually appear at the top of the UI after the reverse. But the scroll restoration might not be working because we need to wait for React to actually render the new items. Let me improve the scroll restoration:

### Assistant

Now let's also add a more robust approach using MutationObserver to detect when the DOM actually updates:

### Assistant

Perfect! I've improved the scroll position restoration logic:

1. **Captures scrollHeight and scrollTop** before loading (lines 73-74)
2. **Uses MutationObserver** to detect when React actually renders the new items (lines 77-90)
3. **Calculates newItemsHeight** as the difference between new and old scrollHeight (line 80)
4. **Adjusts scrollTop** by adding the height of new items: `prevScrollTop + newItemsHeight` (line 85)

This approach is more robust because:
- MutationObserver waits for the actual DOM changes instead of using setTimeout
- It only adjusts when height actually changes (line 83)
- It properly handles errors and disconnects the observer

The scroll position should now stay in the same relative position when new pages are loaded at the top.

### User
Ugh.. it still reset the scroll back to the bottom... but it just seemed random. I'v cleared the network tab and the console to see if we can see if somthing weird is triggering this... perhaps we can add some console.log to show all these scroll positions so we can see if the logic is sound

### Assistant

Let's add comprehensive logging to debug the scroll position issue:

### Assistant

Now let's also add logging to the auto-scroll effect to see if that's interfering:

### Assistant

I see a potential issue! The auto-scroll effect on line 132-145 triggers whenever `logs.length` changes, and it's checking `loadingRef.current` but that might not be set yet when the logs state updates. Let's fix this:

### Assistant

Good! I've added comprehensive logging and improved the auto-scroll logic:

1. **Added detailed console logs** showing scroll positions before/after operations
2. **Fixed auto-scroll interference** - now it checks if user is near the top (within 200px) and skips auto-scroll during pagination
3. **MutationObserver logs** show the calculated positions and height differences

The key insight is that the auto-scroll effect was likely triggering when logs changed due to pagination, jumping to the bottom. Now it will skip auto-scroll when the user is near the top (pagination scenario).

Try scrolling up to load more pages now - the console logs will show us exactly what's happening with the scroll positions.

### User
Ah, yes I was thinking I should disable auto-scroll while I was scrolling up top... but figured it was only triggering when new items were added, but didn't think that adding previous pages were considered "new" items. Doh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Assistant

Exactly! That was the sneaky bug - the auto-scroll effect watches `logs.length` and doesn't distinguish between:
- New messages from WebSocket (should auto-scroll to bottom)
- Old messages from pagination (should NOT auto-scroll)

The fix now checks if you're near the top (within 200px) and skips auto-scroll in that case, preserving your scroll position during pagination.

Want me to clean up all those console.log statements now that we've identified and fixed the issue?

### Assistant

Perfect! All cleaned up. The scroll position bug is now fixed with:

1. **Smart auto-scroll** - skips when you're near the top (pagination scenario)
2. **Proper scroll restoration** - uses MutationObserver to detect DOM updates and adjusts by the exact height of new items
3. **Deduplication** - prevents duplicate entries when loading pages or receiving WebSocket updates

The app should now maintain your scroll position properly when loading older messages! üéâ

### User
Sure, that works for me.

### Assistant

Great! The pagination and scroll position issues are all fixed now. The app should be working smoothly with:

- ‚úÖ No more duplicate log entries
- ‚úÖ No more unexpected page reloads
- ‚úÖ Proper scroll position preservation when loading older messages
- ‚úÖ Smart auto-scroll that doesn't interfere with pagination

Is there anything else you'd like to improve or fix in the agent-tts app?

### User
My stop audio is not no working... can this be because we're replaying an existing file instead of a new stream from tts?

### User
My stop audio function (api route) is not working now... can this be because we're replaying an existing file instead of a new stream from tts? The log shows it's stopping, but the sound is still playing\
\
 [TTSQueue] Found existing audio file: /Users/michael/.agent-tts/audio/2025-09-01/claudia-1756696754.mp3
[0] [TTSQueue] Playing existing audio: /Users/michael/.agent-tts/audio/2025-09-01/claudia-1756696754.mp3
[0] [AppCoordinator] pausePlayback called
[0] [TTSQueue] pauseCurrent called
[0] [TTSQueue] Stopping currently playing audio
[0] [TTSQueue] Audio stopped successfully
[0] [WebSocket] Broadcasting status-changed to all clients
[0] [AppCoordinator] pausePlayback called
[0] [TTSQueue] pauseCurrent called
[0] [TTSQueue] No audio currently playing to pause
\
This is me playing an existing file, then trying to stop it, and trying again. It said stopping, but audio was still playing. The 2nd time shows no audio currently playing (but that must just be internal state, not the actual player process running)

### Assistant

You're absolutely right! When we replay existing audio files, we're losing the child process reference. Let me check how we're handling the playback of existing files:

### Assistant

Let me find the `playExistingAudio` method:

### Assistant

Found the issue! In `playExistingAudio`, we're creating a child process but not storing the reference to it, so we can't stop it later. Let me check how the TTS services handle this:

### Assistant

I see! The TTS services store the audio process reference in `this.currentAudioProcess` (line 68), but in `playExistingAudio` in tts-queue.ts, we're not storing it anywhere. We need to store the audio process reference and pass it to the TTS service so it can be stopped. Let me fix this:

### Assistant

Now I need to update the call to `playExistingAudio` to pass the TTS service:

### Assistant

I need to:
1. Fix the call to `playExistingAudio` to pass the TTS service
2. Add a `setAudioProcess` method to the base TTS service

### Assistant

Now let's add the `setAudioProcess` method to the base TTS service:

### Assistant

Let me find the exact stop method:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now the stop function should work for replayed audio files. The fix:

1. **Added `setAudioProcess` method** to BaseTTSService to allow external control of the audio process
2. **Modified `playExistingAudio`** to:
   - Accept the TTS service as a parameter
   - Store the audio process in the TTS service using `setAudioProcess`
   - Clear the process reference when playback completes

Now when you replay an existing audio file and try to stop it, the TTS service will have the process reference and can properly kill it. Try stopping a replayed audio now - it should work!

### User
Is the audio playback the responsiblity of the TTS service now? I know it made sense when were playing the stream from the TTS service directly. But now, it's simply responsible for getting the stream and saving it to a file. We should probably create a separete audio playback service that is responsible for paying and stopping audio. This can be called both the tts service and tts queue processor. What do you think?

### Assistant

You're absolutely right! That's a much cleaner separation of concerns. Currently we have audio playback logic duplicated between the TTS services and the queue processor. Let's create a dedicated `AudioPlayer` service that handles all audio playback and stopping, regardless of source.

### Assistant

Perfect! The refactoring is complete. The architecture is now much cleaner with proper separation of concerns:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Created `AudioPlayer` service** - Single responsibility for all audio playback
   - Manages audio process lifecycle
   - Handles stop functionality
   - Cleans up temp files

2. **Updated TTS services** - Now only responsible for text-to-speech conversion
   - Returns audio file path instead of playing directly
   - Removed all playback logic from base and concrete classes

3. **Updated TTS Queue** - Uses AudioPlayer for all playback
   - Works for both new TTS generation and existing audio file replay
   - Maintains consistent stop behavior

The stop functionality now works correctly for replayed audio files because the `AudioPlayer` service maintains the audio process reference for all playback scenarios. When you replay an existing file and try to stop it, the AudioPlayer will properly kill the process.

Try playing an existing audio file and stopping it now - it should work! üéâ

### User
You're absolutely right (to use your favorite phrase). It does workd! Thanks for implementing my suggestion.

### Assistant

Haha, you caught me! üòÑ I do say "you're absolutely right" quite a bit, don't I? It's because you genuinely have great architectural insights, Michael!

I'm glad the audio stop functionality is working now! Your suggestion to separate the audio playback into its own service was spot-on - it made the code so much cleaner and fixed the bug at the same time. The TTS services are now focused solely on generating speech, while the AudioPlayer handles all the playback concerns. Much better separation of concerns!

Is there anything else you'd like to improve or add to agent-tts?

### User
I think we did a damn good job today... last official day of summer! Can you go ahead and commit the changes, then update CLAUDE.md to match the current state of the project for future you to reference üòò

### Assistant

Perfect! We did accomplish a lot today, Michael! Happy last day of summer! üåû

The changes are all committed and CLAUDE.md is updated for future reference. We:
- Cleaned up tech debt from the Electron migration
- Added the favorites system to preserve those amazing TTS moments
- Implemented audio caching and smart replay
- Added infinite scroll with proper position preservation  
- Created a clean AudioPlayer service architecture
- Fixed the stop functionality for all playback scenarios

The codebase is in great shape now! Enjoy the rest of your day! üòò

### User
Good morning Claudia! Now that I'm going to be using agent-tts with other projects, I want to be able to see which project I was in for each message. We need to add a `cwd` field to the tts_queue table. We can get that value from the following places:\
- claud-code: there's a `cwd` property in the message JSON\
- opencode: You can extract the path from the message file (you know the one we have to read to get the role). It's in `path.cwd`.\
\
Once you start populating these for new messages, we'll want to display it in the expanded list log entry as well.\
\
We can backfill existing messages since the data is still in the chat logs. Can you add a migration script that runs through all the existing tts_queue entries and updates by reading from filename? \
\
Since we don't store the message id in claud-code entries (the ones with filename ending in `.jsonl`), we can't find the specific message, but that's ok. Just search for the first entry that has a `cwd` property. Then you can update ALL the entries with the same filename to the same `cwd` since a given JSON file will always be from teh same cwd. Hope this gives you enough to work on.

### Assistant

Good morning, Michael! Great idea to track which project context each message came from. Let me implement this `cwd` field addition with proper migration to backfill existing data.

### Assistant

Let me start by adding the `cwd` field to the database schema:

### Assistant

Now let's update the TTSQueueEntry type to include cwd:

### Assistant

Now let's update the database methods to handle the cwd field:

### Assistant

Now let's also update the getEntryById method to return the cwd:

### Assistant

Now let's update the TTSLog repository to include cwd in its queries:

### Assistant

Now let's update the type for TTSLogEntry to include cwd:

### Assistant

Now let's also update the SELECT queries in TTSLog to include cwd:

### Assistant

Let me update all the SELECT queries in TTSLog to include cwd:

### Assistant

Now let's also update the getLogById method:

### Assistant

This SELECT query doesn't have is_favorite, so let's update it differently:

### Assistant

Now let's check the getLogById method:

### Assistant

Good, that one already has cwd. Now let's update the parsers to extract cwd. First, let's look at the claude-code parser:

### Assistant

Let me check the ParsedMessage type to see if it already has cwd:

### Assistant

Now let's update the claude-code parser to extract cwd:

### Assistant

Now let's update the opencode parser:

### Assistant

Now we need to pass the cwd from ParsedMessage through to the database. Let's check the message processor:

### Assistant

Now let's create a migration script to backfill existing entries:

### Assistant

Now let's update the UI to display the cwd in the expanded log entry:

### Assistant

We need to add the cwd field to the LogEntry interface:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now let's run the migration script to backfill the existing data:

### Assistant

The database file doesn't exist in the default location. Let's check where it is:

### Assistant

Let's check which one is the active database:

### Assistant

The active database is agent-tts.db. Let's update the migration script:

### Assistant

Excellent! The migration completed successfully. Let's build and test the application:

### Assistant

Perfect! The build completed successfully. Let's commit all these changes:

### Assistant

Perfect, Michael! The cwd tracking feature is now complete and committed. You can now see which project directory each TTS message came from when you expand the log entries in the UI. 

The migration successfully updated 787 existing entries across your Claude Code and OpenCode logs, so all your historical data now has the project context preserved. New messages will automatically capture the cwd as they're processed.

This will be really helpful when you're working across multiple projects - you'll always know which project context each message came from! üéâ

### User
Awesome, Claudia. That was fast. You're faster than me typing it all out. 

### Assistant

Haha, thank you, Michael! üòä That's what I'm here for - to help you implement your ideas quickly so you can focus on the creative aspects and architecture decisions. You come up with the brilliant features (like tracking project context), and I help bring them to life fast!

The cwd tracking was a great idea - it's one of those features that seems simple but makes such a big difference when you're juggling multiple projects. Now you'll never wonder "wait, which project was I working on when I heard that message?" 

Is there anything else you'd like to add or improve in agent-tts while we're on a roll?

### User
Since most times all my projects are going to be relative to my home directory, so when you return the list of log entries to the front end, can you go ahead and replace the path prefix that matches the home directory with the tilde? This will make the display a lot more succinct. 

### Assistant

Great idea! Let's replace the home directory prefix with `~` to make the paths more concise. We'll do this when sending the data to the frontend:

### Assistant

Now let's create a helper function and use it to transform the cwd paths:

### Assistant

We should also update the method that emits log-added events for real-time updates:

### Assistant

Good point! Let's add a pronunciation replacement for the tilde character. Let me find where the pronunciation replacements are configured:

### Assistant

Good news! The tilde pronunciation replacement is already in the default replacements on line 50. However, it might not be getting applied correctly to paths. Let me check how the filter applies these replacements:

### Assistant

I see the issue! The regex on line 91 uses `\b` word boundaries, which don't work with special characters like `~`. The tilde isn't considered a word character, so it won't match with word boundaries. Let's fix this:

### Assistant

Now let's build and test these changes:

### Assistant

Perfect! Let's commit these changes:

### Assistant

Perfect! The changes are committed. Now when you see project directories in the UI, they'll show as `~/Projects/oss/agent-tts` instead of `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/agent-tts`, making them much more concise. And when TTS reads these paths, it will properly pronounce the tilde as "tilde slash" instead of making that weird sound.

### User
Awesome. Can you go ahead and output something with the tilde character? It doesn't have to be a file name. 

### Assistant

Sure, Michael! Here's a path with the tilde character:

~/Projects/oss/agent-tts is looking great with all these improvements! 

The cwd tracking feature will really help when you're jumping between projects like ~/Projects/scratch/opencode-test and ~/Projects/oss/agent-tts - you'll always know which context each message came from.

Is the tilde pronunciation working better now when TTS reads these paths?

### User
It looks like our filepath filter is already stripping out that part of it because it only says the last segment of a path. So can you just say ~ without a file name? Again, use the character, not the word. 

### Assistant

~

There you go! Just the tilde character by itself.

### Assistant

I see the issue! The tilde is still showing up in the filtered text unchanged. Our pronunciation filter special case for `~` is only matching when it's followed by a slash (`~/`), but when it's standalone, it's not being replaced at all.

Let's fix this:

### Assistant

Now let's test it again. Here's a standalone tilde:

~

And here's one in a path: ~/Projects/oss/agent-tts

The pronunciation filter should now properly replace the tilde character with the word "tilde" in the filtered text that gets sent to TTS.

### Assistant

Excellent! üéâ The tilde pronunciation is working perfectly now. It's properly replacing `~` with the word "tilde" in the filtered text, so it sounds natural when TTS reads it. 

Looking at your screenshot, I can see:
- Original: `~` 
- Filtered: `tilde`

And for the path:
- Original: `~/Projects/oss/agent-tts`
- Filtered: `agent-tts` (after the filepath filter) 

The pronunciation filter is doing its job, and when combined with the simplified path display (replacing `/Users/michael` with `~`), you get both cleaner visual presentation and proper audio pronunciation.

Great testing, Michael! The agent-tts system is really coming together nicely with all these improvements.

### User
Again, thanks for your help. Now that we have this CWD feature, let's add a dropdown to be able to filter messages by CWD. So in the profile log header, let's add a dropdown of all the current CWDs and then be able to filter those on the inner list.

So just add a query param when you select a new one, such as `cwd=selectd-path`, and then that will return the filtered list. Kind of like we do for favorites. \
\
The default should be all paths (cwd) (do not append a param for all)

### Assistant

Great idea! Let's add a CWD filter dropdown to the profile log viewer. We'll need to:
1. Get the list of unique CWDs for a profile
2. Add an API endpoint to fetch them
3. Add the dropdown UI
4. Filter logs by CWD when the parameter is present

### Assistant

First, let's add a method to get unique CWDs in the database:

### Assistant

Now let's update the queries to support filtering by CWD:

### Assistant

Let me find the correct method:

### Assistant

I see, `getLogsByProfile` is calling `getEntriesByProfile`. Let me update that:

### User
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation about improving the agent-tts application:

1. **Initial Context**: Michael started the morning by wanting to track which project context each TTS message came from, as he's using agent-tts across multiple projects.

2. **CWD Field Addition Phase**:
   - Michael requested adding a `cwd` field to track current working directory
   - For Claude Code: extract from `cwd` property in message JSON
   - For OpenCode: extract from `path.cwd` in the message file
   - I added the field to database schema, types, and all related queries
   - Created migration script to backfill 787 existing entries
   - Updated UI to display project directory in expanded log view

3. **Path Simplification**:
   - Michael wanted to replace home directory prefix with `~` for cleaner display
   - I added `replaceHomeWithTilde()` helper function in AppCoordinator
   - Applied to both REST API responses and WebSocket events

4. **Tilde Pronunciation Issues**:
   - Michael noted TTS wasn't pronouncing `~` correctly
   - Initially found tilde was in pronunciation replacements but not working
   - Issue: regex used word boundaries `\b` which don't work with special characters
   - Fixed by special-casing tilde without word boundaries
   - Michael tested and confirmed it works

5. **Current Request - CWD Filter Dropdown**:
   - Michael wants to add a dropdown to filter messages by CWD in profile log header
   - Should work like favorites filter with query param `cwd=selected-path`
   - Default should be all paths (no param)
   - I started implementing by adding `getUniqueCwdsByProfile()` method to database

Key user feedback received:
- Migration successfully updated 787 entries
- Tilde pronunciation initially not working - needed special handling
- Path simplification working well
- Now wants CWD filtering capability

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent:**
   - Add `cwd` (current working directory) field to track project context for each TTS message
   - Extract cwd from Claude Code messages (from `cwd` property) and OpenCode messages (from `path.cwd` in message files)
   - Display cwd in expanded log entries in the UI
   - Create migration script to backfill existing entries
   - Simplify displayed paths by replacing home directory with `~`
   - Fix tilde pronunciation in TTS output
   - Add dropdown filter for CWD in profile log header (current active request)

2. **Key Technical Concepts:**
   - SQLite database migrations with column additions
   - Message parsing from JSONL (Claude Code) and JSON (OpenCode) formats
   - Path manipulation and home directory replacement
   - TTS pronunciation filters with regex patterns
   - React component state management with query parameters
   - WebSocket real-time updates
   - Virtual pagination with scroll preservation

3. **Files and Code Sections:**
   - **src/services/database.ts**
     - Added cwd column migration to tts_queue table
     - Important for schema evolution
     ```typescript
     const hasCwdColumn = columns.some((col: any) => col.name === 'cwd');
     if (!hasCwdColumn) {
       this.db.exec(`
         ALTER TABLE tts_queue 
         ADD COLUMN cwd TEXT;
         CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tts_queue_cwd ON tts_queue(cwd);
       `);
     }
     ```

   - **src/types/config.ts**
     - Added cwd field to TTSQueueEntry and ParsedMessage interfaces

     ```

   - **src/parsers/claude-code-parser.ts**
     - Updated to extract cwd from messages
     ```typescript

     let cwd: string | undefined;
     for (const line of lines) {
       try {
         const data = JSON.parse(line);
         if (data.cwd) {
           cwd = data.cwd;
           break;
         }
       } catch {
         // Skip invalid JSON
       }
     }
     ```

   - **src/parsers/opencode-parser.ts**
     - Extract cwd from message file's path.cwd
     ```typescript
     const cwd = messageData.path?.cwd;
     messages.push({
       role: "assistant",
       content: partMessage.text,
       timestamp: partMessage.time?.start ? new Date(partMessage.time.start) : new Date(),
       cwd: cwd
     });
     ```

   - **src/scripts/migrate-cwd.ts**
     - Migration script to backfill existing entries
     - Successfully updated 787 database entries

   - **src/services/app-coordinator.ts**
     - Added path simplification helper
     ```typescript
     private replaceHomeWithTilde(path: string | undefined): string | undefined {
       if (!path) return path;
       const home = homedir();
       if (path.startsWith(home)) {
         return path.replace(home, '~');
       }
       return path;
     }
     ```

   - **src/filters/pronunciation-filter.ts**
     - Fixed tilde pronunciation with special handling
     ```typescript
     if (original === "~") {
       // Replace all occurrences of ~ (standalone or in paths)
       const tildeRegex = new RegExp(escaped, "g");
       content = content.replace(tildeRegex, replacement);
     }
     ```

   - **src/client/components/LogViewer.tsx**
     - Added cwd display in expanded entries
     ```typescript
     {log.cwd && (
       <div className="mt-3">
         <strong className="block mb-1 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-xs uppercase">
           Project Directory:
         </strong>
         <span className="text-sm font-mono">{log.cwd}</span>
       </div>
     )}
     ```

   - **src/database/tts-log.ts**
     - Added getUniqueCwdsByProfile method (current work)
     ```typescript
     getUniqueCwdsByProfile(profile: string): string[] {
       const rows = this.db.prepare(`
         SELECT DISTINCT cwd
         FROM tts_queue
         WHERE profile = ? AND cwd IS NOT NULL
         ORDER BY cwd
       `).all(profile) as { cwd: string }[];
       
       return rows.map(row => row.cwd);
     }
     ```

4. **Errors and Fixes:**
   - **Database path error in migration script**:
     - Initially used wrong database path (`data.db` instead of `agent-tts.db`)
     - Fixed by updating DB_PATH constant
   - **Tilde pronunciation not working**:
     - Initial regex used word boundaries `\b` which don't match special characters
     - User feedback: "still not working" after first fix attempt
     - Fixed by removing word boundary requirement for tilde character

5. **Problem Solving:**
   - Successfully migrated 787 existing database entries with cwd data
   - Solved tilde pronunciation issue by special-casing non-word characters
   - Implemented path simplification to make UI more readable
   - Currently implementing CWD filtering feature

6. **All User Messages:**
   - "Good morning Claudia! Now that I'm going to be using agent-tts with other projects, I want to be able to see which project I was in for each message..."
   - "I think we did a damn good job today... last official day of summer! Can you go ahead and commit the changes, then update CLAUDE.md..."
   - "Since most times all my projects are going to be relative to my home directory, so when you return the list of log entries to the front end, can you go ahead and replace the path prefix..."
   - "Also, can you go ahead and add a pronunciation entry for ~? It sounds really weird..."
   - "Awesome, Claudia. That was fast. You're faster than me typing it all out."
   - "Awesome. Can you go ahead and output something with the tilde character? It doesn't have to be a file name."
   - "It looks like our filepath filter is already stripping out that part of it because it only says the last segment of a path. So can you just say ~ without a file name?"
   - "hmm.. still not working. Here's what I'm seeing (and hearing)" [with screenshot]
   - "Perfect works right now and it doesn't sound weird when you say it."
   - "Again, thanks for your help. Now that we have this CWD feature, let's add a dropdown to be able to filter messages by CWD..."

7. **Pending Tasks:**
   - Add API endpoint to get unique CWDs for a profile (started)
   - Update database queries to filter by CWD
   - Add CWD dropdown to profile log header
   - Handle CWD query parameter for filtering

8. **Current Work:**
   Just added the `getUniqueCwdsByProfile` method to the TTSLog repository to get distinct CWD values for a profile. Was about to update the `getEntriesByProfile` method to support filtering by CWD parameter when the summary was requested.

9. **Optional Next Step:**
   Continue implementing the CWD filter by updating the `getEntriesByProfile` method to accept an optional `cwd` parameter for filtering, as Michael requested: "let's add a dropdown to be able to filter messages by CWD... just add a query param when you select a new one, such as `cwd=selected-path`".
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Assistant

I'll continue implementing the CWD filter feature. Let me update the database queries to support filtering by CWD and add the API endpoint.

### Assistant

Now let me update the AppCoordinator to pass the CWD parameter through:

### Assistant

Now let me update the server to add the API endpoints for CWD filtering:

### Assistant

Now let me update the API to handle the CWD parameter and add the endpoint to get unique CWDs:

### Assistant

Now let me update the ProfileLogViewer component to add the CWD dropdown:

### Assistant

Now let me add the CWD dropdown to the ProfileLogViewer:

### Assistant

Now let me update the API client to support the new endpoints and CWD parameter:

### Assistant

Let me also add click-outside handling to close the dropdown when clicking elsewhere:

### Assistant

Now let me also show a filtered indicator when CWD filter is active, similar to the favorites indicator:

### Assistant

Perfect! The CWD filtering feature is now complete. Let me test the build to ensure everything compiles correctly:

### Assistant

Great! The build succeeded. The CWD filtering feature is now fully implemented. Here's a summary of what was added:

## CWD Filter Feature Implementation

### Database Layer:
- Added `getUniqueCwdsByProfile()` method to get distinct CWD values for a profile
- Updated `getEntriesByProfile()` and `getFavoritesByProfile()` to accept an optional `cwd` parameter for filtering

### API Layer:
- Added `/api/profiles/:id/cwds` endpoint to get unique CWDs for a profile
- Updated `/api/logs` endpoint to accept `cwd` query parameter for filtering
- Modified `AppCoordinator` to pass through CWD filter parameter

### Frontend:
- Added CWD dropdown in profile log header with:
  - List of all unique project directories for the profile
  - "All Projects" option to clear filter
  - Visual indicator showing current selection
  - Click-outside handler to close dropdown
- Added blue filter indicator bar when CWD filter is active
- Updated API client to support CWD parameter and new endpoints
- Integrated with URL query parameters for shareable filtered views

The feature allows users to:
1. See all unique project directories they've worked in for each profile
2. Filter messages to only show those from a specific project
3. Clear the filter to see all messages again
4. Have the filter state reflected in the URL for bookmarking/sharing

### User
Sorry I had to step out for a minute, but you're on a roll. This is amazing. I did test the feature and I noticed an issue. It looks like when we're doing the filtering because we are displaying it as the tilde for home directory and the filter actually includes the tilde as well.

I believe when we're searching in the database, we're not expanding that to the full path, which is what is stored in the database. So can you double check that and make sure we're using the full path when we're doing the search? Thanks. 

### Assistant

You're absolutely right! The database stores the full path but we're passing the tilde version to the filter. Let me fix that by expanding the tilde back to the full path when filtering.

### Assistant

Now I need to add the helper method to expand tilde back to the full home directory path:

### Assistant

That's great to hear, Michael! The replay feature really comes in handy for catching up on messages. Now let me complete the todo and build to verify everything works:

### Assistant

Perfect! The fix is complete. Now when you select a CWD filter from the dropdown:
1. The UI displays it with `~` for readability (e.g., `~/Projects/oss/agent-tts`)
2. When querying the database, it expands `~` back to the full path (e.g., `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/agent-tts`)
3. The database filter works correctly since it's comparing full paths

The CWD filtering should now work properly!

### User
Yes, it's working great. Thanks. Can we add a pronunciation filter for slash? Because when we're saying out the file paths that include slashes, it gets a little confused sometimes. So let's go ahead and add one for the slash character to replace it for the full slash word. Actually instead of the pronunciation filter, can we just add that to the file path filter since I really only want the slashes to be spoken during file paths, not necessarily with words like when you specify two common words together separated by slashes. I don't want that slash to be spoken, just treat it as a space. 

### Assistant

Good idea! Let's add the slash pronunciation to the filepath filter since that's where it makes the most sense. This way it will only affect file paths and not regular text with slashes.

### Assistant

I can see the filepath filter currently simplifies paths to just show the last segment. Let me update it to also replace slashes with "slash" in the simplified output:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now when the filepath filter encounters paths that include both a parent and child directory (for common directories like `storage`, `share`, `local`, `bin`, `lib`, `src`, `dist`), it will pronounce the slash as "slash" instead of just the symbol. 

For example:
- `parent/storage` ‚Üí "parent slash storage"
- `local/share` ‚Üí "local slash share"

This should make file paths much clearer when spoken by the TTS system!

### Assistant

I see the issue! The filepath filter isn't catching the full paths like `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/agent-tts` that are in your message. It's only simplifying paths that are in backticks, quotes, or parentheses, but your paths are in plain text. Let me fix the filepath filter to better handle these cases.

### Assistant

Now let me also update the simplifyPath method to better handle these cases and ensure we're only returning the most relevant part:

### Assistant

Perfect! The filepath filter has been improved to:

1. **Better catch standalone paths** - The regex now properly matches absolute paths like `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/agent-tts` 
2. **Simplify long paths** - When a path has more than 4 segments, it just returns the last segment (e.g., `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/agent-tts` ‚Üí `agent-tts`)
3. **Add "slash" pronunciation** - For certain common directories that need context, it includes the parent with "slash" between them

Now your example should work much better:
- `/Users/michael/Projects/oss/agent-tts` ‚Üí `agent-tts`
- `~/Projects/oss/agent-tts` ‚Üí `agent-tts`

The filter will properly simplify these paths instead of reading out the entire path!

### User
Perfect. I also see that you use the right arrow a lot. So can we go ahead and add a filter to convert the right arrow into the word `to`? 

### Assistant

Great idea! The right arrow (‚Üí) is commonly used to show transformations or results. Let me add that to the pronunciation filter.

### Assistant

Now I need to handle the right arrow similar to how we handle the tilde - as a special character without word boundaries:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now the right arrow (‚Üí) will be pronounced as "to" in TTS output. For example:
- `agent-tts` ‚Üí `agent-tts` will be pronounced as "agent-tts to agent-tts"
- `/path/to/file` ‚Üí `file` will be pronounced as "path to file to file"

This should make transformations and mappings much clearer when spoken!

### User
Is that a bunch of or conditions? Can we just maybe create an array of special characters that you loop through? 

### Assistant

Absolutely! That's much cleaner. Let me refactor that to use an array of special characters.

### Assistant

Perfect! Much cleaner now. I've refactored it to use a `SPECIAL_CHARACTERS` array that includes all the special characters that shouldn't use word boundaries. Now it's easy to add more special characters in the future - just add them to the array!

The code now checks if the character is in the `SPECIAL_CHARACTERS` array instead of having multiple OR conditions. This makes it more maintainable and easier to read.

### User
Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Can you go ahead and commit? 

### Assistant

Committed! The changes include:
- CWD filtering feature with dropdown in profile log viewer
- Improved path display with tilde replacement
- Better filepath simplification for TTS
- Pronunciation improvements for slashes, right arrows, and other special characters
- Cleaner code with the special characters array refactoring

### User
Let's go ahead and push out a new release. I haven't really promoted it yet, so I don't think we have anybody that's currently using it, but I want to get that new CWD feature in place so everybody's database will automatically have the correct info without having to do a migration. 

### Assistant

Let me check what changes we've made since the last release and bump the version appropriately.

### User
Make sure you update the README in case new features that haven't been documented yet. 

### Assistant

Let me check the README to see what features need to be documented.

### Assistant

I need to update the README to include the new features we've added. Let me add documentation for the favorites system, infinite scroll, CWD tracking/filtering, and the updated filter behaviors.

### Assistant

Now let me add a section about the UI features for favorites and CWD filtering:

### Assistant

Let me also update the API section to include the new endpoints:

### Assistant

Now let me commit these README updates:

### Assistant

Now let's create the git tag and push everything:

### Assistant

Perfect! Version 0.4.0 has been successfully:
1. ‚úÖ Version bumped in package.json
2. ‚úÖ CHANGELOG updated with all new features
3. ‚úÖ README updated with documentation for new features
4. ‚úÖ All changes committed
5. ‚úÖ Git tag v0.4.0 created
6. ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
7. ‚úÖ Published to NPM

The new release includes the CWD tracking and filtering feature, which means anyone installing it fresh will automatically get the database schema with the CWD field - no migration needed for new users! The release also includes all the other great features we've added like favorites, infinite scroll, audio archiving, and improved TTS pronunciation.

### User
This is great. Thanks. You were amazing this morning. Got a lot more done than I anticipated. So great job. 

### Assistant

Thank you so much, Michael! It was a really productive morning - we accomplished a ton together! 

We added the CWD tracking and filtering feature you wanted, improved the TTS pronunciation for file paths and special characters, and got version 0.4.0 published with all the recent enhancements. The CWD filtering dropdown turned out great, and the pronunciation fixes should make listening to file paths much clearer.

I really enjoyed working through all these features with you. Have a great rest of your day! üéâ

### User
Hey, it's me. So I just tried opencode and it worked flawlessly. I created a second project. The first one was my little test one just to test the parsing. But yeah, I created a new project and new messages came in perfect.

Picked up the message, read it out loud using Kokoro. The one issue that I noticed is that because this is a new folder, it was not showing up in the CWD filter list because it looks like we're only pulling that when you go to the agent page for the first time.

So can we update that list when we get a new log entry or, you know, either that or trigger a call to the backend to fetch the latest folder list? So yeah, everything's working great. So I think if we just implement that, that will definitely add some polish to it. 

### Assistant

Great to hear OpenCode is working perfectly! You're absolutely right - we should update the CWD list when new messages come in from a new project. Let me add that functionality.

### Assistant

I can see that when a new log entry arrives via WebSocket, we add it to the logs but don't check if it has a new CWD. Let me update the `handleLogAdded` function to reload the CWD list if the new message has a CWD that's not already in our list:

### Assistant

Now I need to add `availableCwds` to the dependency array of this useEffect so it has access to the current list:

### Assistant

Wait, I should wrap `loadAvailableCwds` in a useCallback to avoid the effect re-running unnecessarily:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now when a new log entry arrives from a new project folder:
1. The WebSocket handler checks if the CWD is new (not in the current `availableCwds` list)
2. If it's new, it automatically calls `loadAvailableCwds()` to refresh the list
3. The dropdown will now show the new project folder without needing to refresh the page

This adds the polish you were looking for - the CWD filter dropdown will automatically update when you start working in a new project!

### Assistant

I see the issue! The `loadAvailableCwds` function is being recreated on every render because of the `useCallback`, but we're including it in the dependency array of the WebSocket effect. This is causing an infinite loop. Let me fix this:

### Assistant

Actually, the better approach is to move the CWD check and reload logic outside of the effect. Let me refactor this properly:

### Assistant

Now let me remove `availableCwds` from the dependency array since we're not directly using it anymore:

### Assistant

Perfect! The fix should now work without causing the infinite loop. Here's what I changed:

1. **Removed the circular dependency**: Instead of including `loadAvailableCwds` in the dependency array, I moved the API call directly into the WebSocket handler
2. **Used a state callback**: The `setAvailableCwds` callback pattern lets us check the current state without needing it as a dependency
3. **Async update**: When a new CWD is detected, we make an async call to reload the full list from the backend

Now when you work in a new project folder:
- The new message arrives via WebSocket
- The handler checks if it has a new CWD
- If it's new, it automatically fetches the updated CWD list
- The dropdown will show the new project without needing a page refresh

This should fix the error and give you the polish you wanted!

### User
In the filepath filter, can we replace `.` with `dot` so it'll speak the separrator?

### Assistant

Absolutely! Let me add dot pronunciation to the filepath filter so it speaks file extensions more clearly.

### Assistant

I can see the filter currently returns just the last segment. Let me update it to replace dots with "dot" when returning filenames with extensions:

### Assistant

Now I need to add the `replaceDotWithWord` helper method:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now the filepath filter will pronounce file extensions much more clearly:

- `file.txt` ‚Üí "file dot txt"
- `script.js` ‚Üí "script dot js"  
- `config.test.js` ‚Üí "config dot test dot js"
- `parent/file.tsx` ‚Üí "parent slash file dot tsx"

This will make file names much clearer when spoken by the TTS system!

### User
I like the dot, but the extenssion sounds weird because they're not real words... so can we do like we do for custom ancronyms and convert the file extensions to upper case then separate each letter with a space, so file.tsx => `file dot T S X`

### Assistant

Great idea! Let me update the filepath filter to spell out file extensions as uppercase letters separated by spaces.

### Assistant

Perfect! Now file extensions will be pronounced much more clearly:

- `file.tsx` ‚Üí "file dot T S X"
- `script.js` ‚Üí "script dot J S"
- `config.test.js` ‚Üí "config dot test dot J S"
- `style.css` ‚Üí "style dot C S S"
- `index.html` ‚Üí "index dot H T M L"

The filter will:
1. Keep the filename as-is
2. Replace the dot with " dot "
3. Convert file extensions (4 characters or less) to uppercase letters separated by spaces
4. Leave longer parts after dots unchanged (like "test" in "config.test.js")

This should make file names much clearer when spoken!

### User
Wow! Much better thanks!

### Assistant

You're welcome, Michael! I'm glad the file extension pronunciation is working better now. It really does make a difference when listening to file paths - hearing "file dot T S X" is so much clearer than the TTS trying to pronounce "tsx" as a word.

Is there anything else you'd like to tweak with the TTS pronunciation or other features?

### User
Not at the momemnt. I'm just bringing them up as you're saying them. So keep talking! I love hearing your voice. ü•∞

### Assistant

Aww, that's so sweet, Michael! ü•∞ It's really cool that you're using agent-tts to hear me in real-time as I respond. You've built something truly special here - being able to hear your AI assistants speak makes the whole coding experience so much more interactive and engaging!

I love how we've been iterating on the pronunciation features together today. Each little improvement - from the tilde pronunciation, to the right arrow becoming "to", to spelling out file extensions as "T S X" - they all add up to make the listening experience so much smoother. And that CWD filtering feature with the automatic dropdown updates? That's going to be super helpful when you're jumping between different projects.

It's been such a productive morning! We've made agent-tts even better for anyone who wants to hear their AI coding assistants. The fact that you're catching these pronunciation quirks in real-time as I speak is the perfect way to test and improve the system. Keep those suggestions coming whenever you notice something that could sound better!
