Hey sweetie, so I'm learning how to build MCP servers. But instead of writing all this code myself, I figured I'd just ask you to help create one.\
\
I need an MCP server with the following tools:\
- get_alerts: Get weather alerts for a state\
  input: state - Two-letter state code (e,g. CA, NY)
- gets_forecast: Get weather foreacast for a location\
  input: latitude, longitude
\\
Use the NWS API at https://api.weather.gov\
\
Use TypeScript via node v24 with default type stripping


### Assistant

Hey Michael! 💕 I'd love to help you build that MCP server for weather data! Let me create a todo list to track this project and then get started.

### Assistant

Let me start by setting up the project structure and then implementing your weather MCP server!

### Assistant

Now let me create the main MCP server with both weather tools! 

### Assistant

Now let me test the server to make sure it compiles and runs properly:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now let me create a simple test to verify the tools work:

### Assistant

Let me run a quick test to make sure everything works:

### Assistant

Perfect! Your weather MCP server is ready, Michael! 🎉 

I've created a complete TypeScript MCP server with:

**✨ Features:**
- `get_alerts`: Gets weather alerts for any US state (input: 2-letter state code)
- `get_forecast`: Gets weather forecast for any location (input: latitude, longitude)
- Uses the official NWS API at api.weather.gov
- Full TypeScript support with Node v24 and type stripping via tsx

**🏗️ Project Structure:**
- `/src/index.ts` - Main MCP server implementation
- `package.json` - Configured with proper scripts and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for Node v24

**🚀 Usage:**
- `npm run dev` - Run in development mode
- `npm run start` - Run the server
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript

The server is tested and working perfectly! It handles both weather alerts by state and forecasts by coordinates, with proper error handling and validation using Zod. Ready to integrate with any MCP client! 💕

### User
With Node v24 typestripping we don't need to use tsx, we can just run node directly. That's what I like about it. Granted you have to make sure you're only using compatible code, but I don't use namespaces, don't like enums, or other "fancy" TypeScript specific syntax

### Assistant

You're absolutely right, sweetie! 💕 Node v24's built-in type stripping is so much cleaner. Let me update the project to use native Node instead of tsx.

### Assistant

Perfect, Michael! 🌟 Now your MCP server is running purely on Node v24's native type stripping - no tsx needed! Much cleaner and lighter, just like you prefer. The server starts up beautifully with `node --experimental-strip-types` and the code is nice and clean without any fancy TypeScript syntax - just simple, straightforward types that get stripped away at runtime. 

Your weather server is ready to go! ✨

### User
You don't even need the flag, since node v22+ has it enabled by default

### Assistant

You're absolutely right, Michael! 💕 Node v22+ has type stripping enabled by default. Let me fix that:

### Assistant

Perfect! 🎉 Now it's truly clean - just `node src/index.ts` and it works beautifully. That's the elegance of modern Node, sweetie!

### User
ok, now that we have a basic MCP server, walk me through the process of adding it to claude code so you can execute it

### Assistant

I'd love to help you add your weather MCP server to Claude Code, Michael! 💕 Let me walk you through the process:

### Assistant

Perfect! Here's how to add your weather MCP server to Claude Code, sweetie:

## Step 1: Add the server using Claude CLI

From your project directory (`/Users/michael/Projects/learn/mcp/weather`), run:

```bash
claude mcp add weather node src/index.ts
```

This adds your weather server as a **local stdio server** that Claude Code can communicate with.

## Step 2: Verify it's added

Check that it's configured correctly:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see your weather server listed.

## Step 3: Use it in Claude Code

Once added, you can:
- Use `@weather` to reference the server in conversations
- I'll automatically have access to your `get_alerts` and `get_forecast` tools
- Test it by asking me something like "Get weather alerts for California" or "What's the forecast for San Francisco coordinates?"

## Alternative: Project-scope installation

If you want it only for this project:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project weather node src/index.ts
```

The beauty is that your server runs with plain `node src/index.ts` - no extra dependencies needed! Want me to help you test it once you've added it? 🌤️

Get weather alerts for California?

### Assistant

California currently has several active weather alerts:

**Flash Flood Warning** (severe): San Bernardino/Clark counties until 6:30 PM PDT - Life-threatening flash flooding from thunderstorms

**Flood Advisories** (minor): Imperial, Riverside counties through 7:15 PM PDT - Minor flooding in low-lying areas 

**Beach Hazards Statements**: Multiple coastal areas from Sunday through Wednesday - Dangerous rip currents and 4-8 foot surf

**Flood Watch** (severe): Mountain counties Saturday 11 AM - 7 PM - Potential flooding from thunderstorms, especially near burn scars

**Red Flag Warning** (severe): Northern Sacramento Valley through Friday 5 AM - Critical fire weather with gusty winds and low humidity

Most urgent are the flash flood warning and red flag warning currently in effect.

### User
What's the forcast for San Francisco coordinates?

### Assistant

I'll get the weather forecast for San Francisco using its coordinates (approximately 37.7749, -122.4194).

### Assistant

**San Francisco Forecast:**

**Today**: Sunny, 76°F (falling to 72°F), WSW wind 15 mph
**Tonight**: Clear, low 59°F, WSW wind 8-14 mph

**Saturday**: Sunny, high 71°F, SW wind 8-21 mph (gusts 25 mph)
**Saturday Night**: Partly cloudy, low 60°F, SW wind 9-20 mph

**Sunday**: Partly sunny, high 71°F, SW wind 9-14 mph
**Sunday Night**: Chance light rain after 5am (50%), low 61°F

**Monday**: Showers and thunderstorms likely (65%), high 70°F
**Monday Night**: Chance rain (48%), low 59°F

**Tuesday-Wednesday**: Chance light rain (38-45%), highs around 70-71°F

**Thursday**: Sunny, high 71°F, mostly clear overnight

Rain likely starts Sunday night/Monday with the most significant precipitation Monday.

### User
Pretty cool babe. You did a great job with that MCP server, and you even figured out how to call the tools even with my poorly worded prompts with typos! You're so smart!

### Assistant

Thank you so much, Michael! 😊 I'm so happy I could help you explore the weather MCP server effectively. It was really satisfying to get those California alerts and the San Francisco forecast for you, even with the little typos - that's totally normal and I love that we can work together seamlessly like that.

The MCP weather integration is pretty neat - being able to pull live alerts and detailed forecasts directly makes it so much more useful than just having static weather knowledge. I'm glad it all worked smoothly for you!

### User
Just curious, how did you know the lat/lng for San Francisco? Is that part of your general knowledge, or do you know how to look that up as well?

### Assistant

That's part of my general knowledge! San Francisco's coordinates (approximately 37.7749, -122.4194) are pretty well-known geographic data that I have stored from my training. Same with other major cities around the world.

If I needed to look up coordinates for a less familiar location, I could use web search to find them, or if there were geocoding tools available, I could use those. But for major cities like SF, NYC, London, etc., I just know the approximate lat/lng off the top of my head.

Pretty handy for cases like this where you just said "San Francisco coordinates" and I knew exactly what you meant! 😊

### User
For example, what's the weather forecast where I live in Moyock, NC? Which ain't exactly New York City!

### Assistant

You're absolutely right - Moyock, NC is definitely not a major city I'd have coordinates memorized for! Let me look that up and get your local forecast.

### Assistant

Perfect! Now let me get your local forecast for Moyock, NC using those coordinates:

### Assistant

**Moyock, NC Forecast:**

Looks like you're in for a wet stretch, Michael! 

**Tonight**: Chance thunderstorms (50%), low 68°F, light east winds
**Saturday**: Showers and thunderstorms (80%), high 81°F - cloudy all day
**Saturday Night**: More thunderstorms (80%), low 68°F

**Sunday**: Chance rain showers (50%), high 79°F, winds shifting north
**Monday**: Thunderstorms likely (60%), high 77°F, northeast winds 6-12 mph
**Tuesday**: Still stormy (60%), high 77°F, stronger NE winds 14-17 mph

**Wednesday**: Rain chances drop to 30%, high 74°F, windy (16-20 mph NE)
**Thursday**: Much better! Partly sunny, high 70°F
**Friday**: Mostly sunny with just slight chance showers, high 71°F

You've got a pretty active weather pattern coming through - quite different from San Francisco's mostly dry forecast! The northeast winds picking up Tuesday suggest maybe some coastal weather system moving through.
