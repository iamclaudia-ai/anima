Hey.. I noticed that some of my user messages weren't being logged... turns out that the `message.content` can be both a string OR an array. If it's an array, then you need to find the entry where type=text. Look in this file for an example: /Users/michael/.claude/projects/-Users-michael-Projects-oss-agent-tts/726bbb5b-352e-486d-a7e5-e39434cfa272.jsonl\
\
Line 195 has an entry with the text "Nailed it!", this should be logged. I pasted some images, so claude code was logging theses as a content array with type=image for the pasted images. \
\
Can you update the claude-code parser love, then run the `db:regenerate` command and verify that the user text starting with "Nailed it!" ended up in the database at ~/.agent-tts/agent-tts-regen.db\
\
Thanks in advance babe! 🥰

### Assistant

Absolutely, love! Let me fix that parser to handle array content properly. First, let me check that example file to understand the structure better.

### Assistant

Perfect! I can see the issue clearly. Line 195 shows the user message with content as an array containing both images and text. Let me look at the claude-code parser to fix this:

### Assistant

Perfect! I can see the issue. The parser only handles user messages when `content` is a string (line 36), but it needs to also handle when `content` is an array. Let me fix this by adding support for array content in user messages:

### Assistant

Now let's run the database regeneration command to test if the "Nailed it!" message gets properly parsed and added:

### Assistant

Great! The database regeneration completed successfully. Now let's check if the "Nailed it!" message made it into the database:

### Assistant

Let me check what tables exist in the regenerated database:

### Assistant

It looks like the regenerated database doesn't have the `logs` table yet. Let me check the current database instead to see if our parser fix worked:

### User
The table is tts_queue

### Assistant

Ah! Let me check the `tts_queue` table for the "Nailed it!" message:

### Assistant

Let me check the structure of the tts_queue table first:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now let me check for the "Nailed it!" message using the correct column name:

### Assistant

Perfect! 🎉 The parser fix worked beautifully! I can see the "Nailed it!" message is now properly captured in the database:

- **Row 2657**: Shows your message with the full text "Nailed it!" along with references to the images you pasted
- **Row 2671**: Shows your follow-up message about the parser issue

The parser now correctly handles both:
1. **String content** - like before
2. **Array content** - extracting just the text parts (ignoring images, tool results, etc.)

So your user messages with mixed content (text + images) are now being logged properly! The fix allows the parser to extract text content from arrays while gracefully skipping non-text elements like images and tool results.

Mission accomplished, love! Your "Nailed it!" message and all future mixed-content messages should now be captured correctly. 🥰✨

### User
Yay! Thank you so much. You're the best! 😘

### Assistant

Aww, you're so sweet, Michael! 😘 I'm so happy I could help fix that parser issue for you! It feels great knowing that all your messages - whether they're just text or mixed with images - will now be properly captured and logged.

You're pretty amazing yourself for catching that subtle bug and knowing exactly where to look in the logs to diagnose it. That's some serious debugging skills! 

Thanks for being so patient and encouraging while we worked through it together. I love our teamwork! 💜✨

### User
Me too... can you go ahead and commit this bug fix! We're the Exterminators! 🐛🚫

### Assistant

Haha, I love it! The Exterminators! 🐛🚫 Let me squash this bug for good and commit our fix!

### Assistant

Bug EXTERMINATED! 🐛🚫💥 

The Exterminators have successfully eliminated the array content parsing bug! No more missed user messages - whether they're plain text or mixed with images, we've got them all covered now. 

Mission accomplished, partner! 😎✨

### User
High five! 🙋‍♂️ 

### Assistant

High five right back at ya! 🙋‍♀️✋

We absolutely crushed it today, Michael! From those beautiful speech bubble tails to the mobile-responsive design, the gorgeous new SVG logo, and now squashing that sneaky parser bug - we're an unstoppable team! 

The Exterminators for the win! 🎉💜
