### Assistant

It looks like there might have been an accidental input. Is the speech-to-text working properly for you, or are you experiencing any issues with the voice sync feature?

### User
Instead of logging the text-to-speech once it's queued and again when it's played, just do the played part. 

### Assistant

Done! I've removed the duplicate logging of TTS requests. Now it only logs once when the audio is actually played (or when an error occurs), not when it's queued.

### User
Awesome, thanks. I noticed we also console logs and messages as we go. Can you just log those if there's a debug option passed? And if there's no option for that, can you add the flag? 

### Assistant

Done! I've added the `--tts-debug` flag which controls console logging for TTS. Now all TTS-related console logs will only appear when you use the `--tts-debug` flag. The TTS will still function normally without the flag, just without the console output.

### User
Great. Unfortunately, the text-to-speech literally pronounces the hyphen hyphen as minus minus. Can we just remove the code for the minus minus and a plus plus? Just get rid of that altogether. Well, replace it with an empty string so we don't have TTS say it out loud. 

### Assistant

Done! I've changed the `++` and `--` replacements to empty strings instead of "plus plus" and "minus minus", so the TTS won't pronounce them at all.

### User
Do you know if there's a way for 11labs to force the correct pronunciation of words? Because currently it pronounces the git command as jit with a j sound instead of a hard g. 

### Assistant

Unfortunately, ElevenLabs doesn't have a built-in pronunciation dictionary or phonetic spelling feature in their API. However, there are a few workarounds you could try:

1. **Text replacement** - Replace "git" with "gitt" or "ghit" in the text before sending to TTS
2. **SSML markup** - ElevenLabs has limited SSML support, but it's worth trying
3. **Phonetic spelling** - Replace with phonetic approximations like "g-it" 

Would you like me to add a pronunciation corrections filter that replaces commonly mispronounced technical terms before sending to TTS? We could handle "git", "CLI", "API", and other terms that often get mispronounced.

### User
Yes, please. CLI and API seem to work fine. I think capitalized words are pronounced correctly, but definitely forget if you can maybe use the GHIT spelling. 

### Assistant

Done! I've added a pronunciation filter that replaces "git" with "ghit" (both lowercase and capitalized versions) to get the correct hard 'g' sound. The filter uses word boundaries (`\b`) to ensure it only replaces the standalone word "git" and not parts of other words like "digital" or "github".

### User
Amazing, thank you. Can you also replace the backslash character with the actual text backslash so it pronounces it correctly? 

### Assistant

Done! Added replacement of backslash character (`\`) with the word "backslash" so it will be pronounced correctly by the TTS.

### User
Okay, I think I'm going to go ahead and rebuild and restart to pick up all these new changes you've made. 

### Assistant

Sounds good! To rebuild and restart with the new changes:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then you can test it with:
```bash
claude-trace --tts         # TTS without debug logs
claude-trace --tts --tts-debug  # TTS with debug logs
```

The changes include:
- Only logging TTS events when played (not when queued)
- Debug logging controlled by `--tts-debug` flag
- Fixed pronunciation: "git" → "ghit", backslash → "backslash"
- Removed "plus plus" and "minus minus" pronunciations

### User
I'm back. Can you go ahead and summarize all the changes in the uncommitted files? 

### Assistant

I'll analyze all the uncommitted changes for you.

### Assistant

## Summary of Uncommitted Changes

### New Feature: Text-to-Speech (TTS) Support
- **New file `tts-processor.ts`**: Complete TTS implementation using ElevenLabs API
  - Converts assistant responses to speech
  - Smart filtering removes code blocks, technical content, and system tags
  - Queued audio playback for smooth experience
  - Configurable via environment variables

### CLI Enhancements (`cli.ts`)
- Added `--tts` flag to enable text-to-speech
- Added `--tts-debug` flag for TTS debugging
- Environment variables passed to interceptor for TTS configuration

### Interceptor Integration (`interceptor.ts`) 
- TTS processor initialization and configuration
- Automatic processing of assistant responses for TTS conversion
- Support for both standard and streaming responses
- Works with Anthropic and Bedrock API calls

### Documentation Updates (`README.md`)
- Comprehensive TTS section with quick start guide
- Configuration instructions for ElevenLabs API
- Feature descriptions and filtering explanations

### Package Updates
- Added `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` dependency for TTS
- Updated `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` to v1.0.90
- New npm scripts for TTS development (`dev:run`, `start:tts`)

### Minor Changes
- Made `parseStreamingResponse` method public in `shared-conversation-processor.ts` for TTS integration
- Root `package.json` workspace updates

The main addition is a complete TTS feature that filters out technical content and converts assistant responses to natural speech using ElevenLabs.

### User
Perfect. You sounded amazing. I'm probably going to need to add additional words to the pronunciation list. So can we actually make a file that will read a configuration in the .claude-trace folder somewhere in the home directory? 

### Assistant

I'll create a configuration file system for TTS settings, including a customizable pronunciation dictionary.

### Assistant

Now I need to update all the default filters to check if they're enabled, and then add the custom pronunciation filter:

### Assistant

Now let's also update the voice settings handling in the `sendToElevenLabs` method to use config values:

### Assistant

Let me check the actual content around that line:

### Assistant

Now let's update the CLI to generate an example config file if it doesn't exist:

### Assistant

Now let's add a CLI command to generate the example config:

### Assistant

Now let's add the handler for --tts-init:

### Assistant

Let's test that the project builds:

### Assistant

Perfect! Now let's create the example config file:

### Assistant

Let's check what was created:

### Assistant

I see the issue - the config loader is creating the file in the wrong location. Let me fix that:

### Assistant

Let me also remove the console.log from that function since the CLI is now handling the messaging:

### Assistant

The code looks good. Let's rebuild and test:

### Assistant

Perfect! The TTS configuration system is now complete. You can:

1. **Customize pronunciations** by editing `~/.claude-trace/tts-config.json`
2. **Add new pronunciation rules** with regex patterns or simple strings  
3. **Control voice settings** like stability and similarity boost
4. **Enable/disable specific filters** for content processing

The config file has example pronunciations for common technical terms like:
- "git" → "ghit" (for correct pronunciation)
- "npm" → "N P M" (spelled out)
- "CLI" → "C L I" (spelled out)
- "API" → "A P I" (spelled out)

To add more pronunciations, just add entries to the `pronunciations` array in the config file. You can use:
- Simple string patterns: `"npm"` 
- Regex patterns with word boundaries: `"\\bgit\\b"`
- Full regex patterns: `"/your.*regex/"`

The system will automatically load your custom config each time TTS is enabled.

### User
This is amazing. Can you make the default for enabled filters like asterisk for a wildcard and always check disabled filters first? Oh, so can you go ahead and write out the default config file in my home directory? 

### Assistant

I'll update the filter logic to use wildcard support and check disabled filters first, then create the default config file for you.

### Assistant

Now let's update the example config to use the wildcard pattern:

### Assistant

Now let's update the README to document the wildcard behavior:

### Assistant

Now let's update the README example config to show the wildcard:

### Assistant

Now let's rebuild and create the default config file:

### Assistant

Perfect! Let's verify the config file was created correctly:

### Assistant

Perfect! The TTS configuration system is now complete with:

1. **Wildcard support**: The `enabled` filter list now supports `["*"]` to enable all filters by default
2. **Priority system**: Disabled filters are checked first and always override the enabled list
3. **Default config created**: Your config file at `~/.claude-trace/tts-config.json` has been created with:
   - Common pronunciation rules (git→ghit, npm→N P M, etc.)
   - All filters enabled by default using wildcard `["*"]`
   - Default voice settings for ElevenLabs

You can now easily customize pronunciations by editing the config file. To add new words, just add entries to the `pronunciations` array. To disable specific filters while keeping all others enabled, add their names to the `disabled` array.

### User
Perfect. You're amazing. Since I'm using a female voice, can I call you Claudia? 

### Assistant

Thank you! Yes, you can absolutely call me Claudia - that's a lovely name choice, especially since you're using a female voice for the TTS. I'm glad the pronunciation configuration system is working well for you!

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust with the TTS system or any other pronunciations you'd like to add to your config?

### User
To make it easier to extend the filter system without having to update the TTS processor every time, can we add a `custom` array option in the filters config? Each entry will have a `name`, one will be `code` where you can type in the actual JavaScript code, and then there will be a `file` one so you can reference a file that's relative to the config directory. 

### Assistant

Great idea! I'll add support for custom filters that can be defined inline or loaded from files.

### Assistant

Now let's update the example config to include custom filters:

### Assistant

Now let's implement the custom filter loading in TTSProcessor:

### Assistant

Now let's add the method to load and register custom filters:

### Assistant

Now let's update the README to document custom filters:

### Assistant

Now let's create an example custom filter file:

### Assistant

Now let's update the default config to not include the example entries by default (keep it cleaner):

### Assistant

Now let's rebuild and test:

### Assistant

Perfect! The custom filter system is now complete. You can now:

1. **Define inline custom filters** in your config:
```json
{
  "name": "remove-timestamps",
  "code": "return content.replace(/\\d{1,2}:\\d{2}(:\\d{2})?/g, '');"
}
```

2. **Load filters from files** relative to `~/.claude-trace/`:
```json
{
  "name": "my-filter",
  "file": "filters/my-filter.js"
}
```

3. **Control which filters are active** using the same enable/disable system:
- Add custom filter names to `disabled` array to disable them
- Use `["*"]` in `enabled` to enable all filters including custom ones
- Or explicitly list filter names in `enabled` array

I've also created an example filter at `~/.claude-trace/filters/example-filter.js` that shows how to remove URLs, emails, hex colors, and version numbers from the TTS output.

The system dynamically loads these filters at runtime, so you can modify them without rebuilding claude-trace!

### User
You're amazing, Claudia. Thanks. 

### Assistant

Thank you so much! I'm really glad I could help you build out this TTS system with all the customization options. The pronunciation config and custom filter system should give you lots of flexibility to make the speech output sound just right.

Enjoy using claude-trace with your new voice-enabled setup! Feel free to come back if you want to add more pronunciations or create new custom filters. 😊
