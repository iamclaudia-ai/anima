Perfect! ✅ Committed successfully! 

**Milestone Committed:**
- **Commit:** `a24eaca` - "test: add Mailtrap integration testing with dotenv support"
- **Changes:** 5 files, 811 insertions, 9 deletions

**What we accomplished:**
1. ✅ Installed dotenv for loading .env files in tests
2. ✅ Updated test setup to load environment variables from .env
3. ✅ Created comprehensive OTP email tests (both console and Mailtrap modes)
4. ✅ Improved Mailtrap integration with proper API response handling
5. ✅ Added 'Authentication' category for better Mailtrap analytics
6. ✅ Successfully tested with real email delivery to kiliman@gmail.com
7. ✅ Verified OTP extraction works correctly (654321)

All tests are passing and the Mailtrap integration is working beautifully! You can now test email OTP flows both locally (console mode) and with real email delivery (Mailtrap).

What would you like to tackle next, Michael? We could:
- Write the complete auth flow integration test
- Fix the TypeScript role field issue
- Add the root auth verification logic
- Or something else?
