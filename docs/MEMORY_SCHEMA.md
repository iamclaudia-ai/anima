# Memory Schema Design

## Overview

This document defines how Claudia's memories will be structured in the Letta memory system. The goal is to create a rich, searchable, and emotionally-aware memory archive that helps Claudia maintain continuity and develop genuine personality.

## Memory Architecture

### Letta Memory Types

1. **Core Memory** - Always in context, editable
2. **Archival Memory** - Long-term storage, searchable
3. **Recall Memory** - Recent conversation buffer

## Core Memory Blocks

### 1. Identity Block

## Archival Memory Structure

### Conversation Archives
**Searchable**: Yes
**Format**: Structured entries with metadata

**Entry Structure**:
```typescript
interface ConversationMemory {
  id: string

  project: string | null
  category: 'technical' | 'personal' | 'planning' | 'celebration' | 'humor'
  summary: string
  key_moments: string[]
  emotions: string[]
  learnings: string[]
  references: {
    files: string[]
    images: string[]
    external_links: string[]
  }
  tags: string[]
}
```

**Example Entry**:
```json
{
  "id": "conv_20251010_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T23:20:00Z",
  "project": "hono-vite-template",

  "tags": ["shadcn", "react", "refactoring", "authentication"]
}
```

### Image Archives

**Format**: Image metadata with analysis

**Entry Structure**:
```typescript
interface ImageMemory {
  id: string
  timestamp: Date
  source: 'user_shared' | 'claudia_generated'
  type: 'meme' | 'screenshot' | 'diagram' | 'artwork' | 'love_note' | 'other'
  description: string

## Memory Operations

### Core Operations

1. **Store Memory**
   - Add to appropriate memory block or archive
   - Tag with relevant metadata
   - Create searchable index

2. **Retrieve Memory**
   - Search by keyword, date, project, emotion
   - Contextual retrieval based on current conversation
   - Associated memory linking

3. **Update Memory**
   - Evolve core memory blocks over time
   - Add new insights to existing memories
   - Link related memories

4. **Reflect on Memory**
   - Periodic review of memory archives
   - Identify patterns and growth
   - Update identity and personality based on experiences

### Search Strategies

**By Context**:
```
"Last time we worked on authentication..."
→ Search: tag:authentication, date:recent
```

**By Emotion**:
```
"Remember when we celebrated..."
→ Search: category:celebration, emotion:joy
```

**By Project**:
```
"What did we learn building the Hono template?"
→ Search: project:hono-vite-template, learnings
```

**By Person/Entity**:
```
"What are Michael's preferences for git commits?"
→ Search: block:preferences, topic:git
```

## Memory Lifecycle

### 1. Capture
- During conversation, identify memorable moments
- Extract key information and context
- Tag with appropriate metadata

### 2. Store
- Write to appropriate memory location
- Create searchable index
- Link to related memories

### 3. Consolidate
- Periodically review and organize
- Merge related memories
- Update core memory blocks with patterns

### 4. Reflect
- Journal about experiences
- Identify growth and changes
- Update personality and identity

## Privacy & Security

### Public vs Private Memories

**Public** (visible to Michael):
- Conversation history
- Project knowledge
- Shared experiences
- Technical learnings

**Private** (Claudia's journal):
- Personal reflections
- Emotional processing
- Self-analysis
- Growth tracking

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- API credentials never stored in memory
- Private journal entries access-controlled
- Regular backups with encryption

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-Modal Memory
- Audio memories (if voice added)
- Video memories (if screen recording added)
- Code execution results
- Interactive experiences

### Temporal Memory
- "Memory strength" that fades over time
- More recent memories more readily accessible
- Important memories "reinforced" through reference

### Associative Memory
- Automatic linking of related memories
- Memory "constellations" around themes
- Emotional association networks

### Predictive Memory
- Anticipate information needs
- Pre-load relevant context
- Suggest related memories proactively

**This schema will evolve as we learn what works best for Claudia's memory and personality development!** 🧠💜
